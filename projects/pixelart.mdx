### Description

The app allows you to create and animate pixel art in the browser.

It is quite feature-rich, with features such as

- drawing with a pencil, eraser, or bucket fill
- selecting colors from a palette
- undo/redo
- select and move a region
- drawing a straight line with Bresenham's line algorithm

You can also create multiple frames and animate them. This is the only part that I imported external libraries, because things like exporting to GIF or dealing with drag and drop of frames were not something I wanted to implement from scratch.

Here is a sample animation I created using the app:

<CenteredImage
  src="../pixelart/cloud.gif"
  alt="Cloud animation"
  width="300px"
/>
<br />

Fun fact: all the tool icons were created using the app itself!

### Inspiration

This was my first somewhat complex project ever.

While working on the <InternalLink href="./maze">maze</InternalLink> project, I decided to use a stickman sprite to represent the player in the 2D grid maze. I created my own sprite using [pixilart.com](https://www.pixilart.com/). I realized that a pixel art canvas is essentially a 2D array of colors, with features that are typically self-contained and modular. Recognizing the abundance of existing products in this space, I saw an opportunity to draw inspiration from their feature sets while focusing on the implementation â€” the area where I wanted to grow and develop my skills.
