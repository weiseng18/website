### Description

A 2D grid maze is generated using Prim's algorithm, and the solution is found via DFS.

### Inspiration

This was my first project hosted on Github. At that point, my goal was to learn how to use `git` and familiarize myself with Github Pages. As such I wanted to work on something that I'm familiar with.

I was in the process of re-organizing my competitive programming knowledge. While working on Prim's algorithm, I realized that it could be used for maze generation which is something visual, so I decided to implement it in the browser.

export default ({ children }) => children
